# Discovery Strategies by Site Age

How site maturity affects AI visibility and optimal strategies.

## The Discovery Gap

Research reveals a dramatic visibility gap between new and established sites:

| Site Age | AI Visibility | Traditional SEO Visibility |
|----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| <6 months | ~1% | ~5% |
| 6-24 months | ~3.3% | ~25% |
| 2-5 years | ~60% | ~70% |
| 5+ years | ~99% | ~95% |

**Key insight:** Startups face a **30:1 visibility disadvantage** in AI search compared to established domains.

## Why the Gap Exists

### Knowledge Cutoff Problem
LLMs have training data cutoffs. New sites simply don't exist in the training data of knowledge-based models.

### Domain Authority Signals
AI systems weight traditional authority signals: backlink profiles, brand mentions, social proof, historical content presence.

### The "Recency Wall"
For knowledge-based queries (not real-time search): new entities hit a wall of invisibility. No amount of GEO optimization helps until training data is updated OR web-augmented strategies are used.

## Strategy by Site Age

### Tier 1: Brand New (<6 months)

**Primary focus:** Web-augmented signals, NOT GEO content

**Actions:**
1. **Build Reddit presence** - Participate in relevant subreddits, share helpful content
2. **Earn referring domains** - Guest posts, HARO responses, open source contributions
3. **Social proof accumulation** - Twitter/X, LinkedIn thought leadership, YouTube mentions
4. **Technical foundation** - Implement AgentFacts now (future-proofing), ensure crawlability

**Don't waste time on:** Hedge density optimization, advanced GEO tactics, AI-specific content optimization

### Tier 2: Early Stage (6-24 months)

**Primary focus:** Hybrid approach - web signals + basic GEO

**Actions:**
1. Continue web-augmented signals
2. Begin GEO optimization - audit hedge density, ensure technical visibility
3. Content authority building - publish definitive guides, create citable resources
4. Monitor AI visibility - search for brand in ChatGPT/Perplexity

### Tier 3: Established (2-5 years)

**Primary focus:** Full GEO optimization

**Actions:**
1. Comprehensive GEO audit - hedge density, technical visibility, entity density
2. AgentFacts implementation - full NANDA protocol setup
3. Content refresh - update with confident language, add citations
4. Competitive analysis - how do competitors appear in AI search?

### Tier 4: Authority (5+ years)

**Primary focus:** Maintaining and defending position

**Actions:**
1. Citation monitoring - track AI citations, identify misattributions
2. Advanced GEO tactics - predictive content, structured data for AI
3. Trust optimization - third-party certifications, transparency reports
4. Innovation - early adoption of new protocols, AI standards participation

## Web-Augmented vs Knowledge-Based Queries

### Knowledge-Based Queries
Answered from training data: "What is [concept]?", "How does [tech] work?", "Compare A vs B"
- **New sites:** Invisible
- **Established sites:** Optimize content

### Web-Augmented Queries
Answered with real-time search: "Best [product] in 2025", "Recent [topic] news", "[Brand] reviews"
- **New sites:** Target these
- **Established sites:** Dominate both

## Measuring Progress

### Early Stage Metrics (0-24 months)
- Referring domain count
- Reddit mention volume
- Social media brand mentions
- First AI citation appearance

### Growth Stage Metrics (2-5 years)
- AI citation frequency
- Query coverage
- Hedge density scores
- AgentFacts validation

### Authority Stage Metrics (5+ years)
- Citation accuracy
- Market share of AI visibility
- Competitive citation ratio

## Timeline Expectations

| Milestone | New Site | Established Site |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| First AI mention | 12-18 months | Already there |
| Regular citations | 24-36 months | 3-6 months |
| AI visibility parity | 36-48 months | 6-12 months |
| Authority status | 5+ years | 1-2 years |

## Common Mistakes

### New Sites
- Obsessing over GEO when invisible anyway
- Ignoring web-augmented signals
- Expecting quick AI visibility

### Established Sites
- Assuming SEO = GEO
- Not auditing hedge density
- Ignoring AgentFacts
- Resting on domain authority

## Action Plan Templates

### For New Sites
- Set up Reddit presence in 3 relevant subreddits
- Create HARO account and respond to 5 queries/week
- Implement basic AgentFacts (minimal schema)
- Build 10 high-quality content pieces
- Track referring domain growth monthly

### For Established Sites
- Run full GEO audit
- Remediate top 10 pages for hedge density
- Implement complete AgentFacts
- Refresh content older than 2 years
- Set up AI citation monitoring
- Plan quarterly GEO reviews
